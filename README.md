# Fit-App-iOS
A simple iOS app made as part of an undergraduate thesis. This repository contains two main versions to take note of:
- Default Version: a version made taking into account only the layout and functional requirements
- Accessibility (abbreviated as A11y) Version: built upon the Default Version, this version adds elements to better integrate with iPhone's VoiceOver. As it is essentially an improved version of the Default branch, it's also the version in the Main branch

Other branches are mostly irrelevant and only of interest to those curious about the order of accessibility implementation.

Finally, the code and assets contained within this repository are to be considered available under the MIT License.
